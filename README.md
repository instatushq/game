### 🚀 Get started

You'll need [Godot](https://godotengine.org/download/) installed and accessible from your terminal using the godot command.

If you're on macOS and godot isn't recognized, you can link it with:

```
sudo ln -s /Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot /usr/local/bin/godot
```

### 🛰️ Build

To generate a new build, run:

```
./build.sh
```

This compiles the game and prepares it for deployment.

### 👽 Contribute

Help us make the game better! 

Feel free to fix bugs, or even develop a new mini game. You can fork, branch, and send a pull request.

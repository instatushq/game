# Building Steps

make sure you have godot installed and the binary is accessible via command "godot"
If not, link it by running this command:
`sudo ln -s /Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot /usr/local/bin/godot`

Generate a new by running build.sh
`./build.sh`

deploy by simply pushing to the master branch.
